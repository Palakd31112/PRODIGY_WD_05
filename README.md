Creating a weather app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript involves several key features to make it functional and user-friendly. Here’s a breakdown of these features:

1. User Interface (UI) Design
Location Input: A search bar or input field where users can enter their location (city, zip code, or coordinates).
Weather Display: Sections to show current weather, temperature, weather conditions (sunny, rainy, etc.), and additional details like humidity and wind speed.
Icons: Weather icons or images to visually represent different weather conditions (sun, rain, clouds, etc.).
Responsive Design: Ensure the app is usable on various devices and screen sizes using responsive design techniques in CSS.
2. Weather Data Retrieval
API Integration: Use a weather API (like OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI, or others) to fetch real-time weather data based on the user’s input.
Error Handling: Manage errors gracefully if the location is not found or if there are issues with the API request.
3. Dynamic Content Update
JavaScript Fetch API: Utilize JavaScript to fetch data from the weather API and update the UI with the retrieved information.
Data Parsing: Parse the JSON response from the API to extract necessary weather details.
4. Styling and UX
CSS Styling: Use CSS to style the app and make it visually appealing. This includes layout, colors, fonts, and spacing.
Animations: Consider adding subtle animations or transitions to improve the user experience (e.g., fade in/out for weather data).
